<-------------------------------------------------------------- INTRODUCTION ------------------------------------------------------------------->
Hello, This is Sai teja. I'm a upcoming game developer (unoffical) who lost in the forest of software technologies.
I have created this game which I grew up on, like so many other people and I wanted to re-creat the gameusing web development.
With the help of HTML along with CSS & JavaScript, I was able to bring it to the life. 

<------------------------------------------------------------ VISION & GOAL ------------------------------------------------------------------------>
My main goal was to create an online game which would be educational to the children and improve their vocabulary and spontaneity.
I envisioned this project to be as minimalistic as it can get since children tends to easily get distracted from the flashy colors.
So, I chose the color pallet to be simple yet slighty leans towards modern asethetics/looks.

<-------------------------------------------------------- READABILITY & UNDERSTANDABILITY ------------------------------------------------------->
If you are looking for the same prject and just got into the web development hype trian, don't worry!
I made this code (well, I took some help from the online source) easy to understand with comments to help along.
In order to able to understand the code, ofcourse you need to learn baiscs of web development i.e. HTML, CSS & JS.
Some may say that you also need HTML5 & CSS3 to understand even more but frankly, I don't/didn't learn those 
programming languages to write the code. You will be fine if you have enough knowledge regarding html, css & js.

<------------------------------------------------------------------- USABILITY   ------------------------------------------------------------------------>
Tbh, I took some help while making this project such as searching through overstack for the syntaxs and stuff like that
so, it would be insane of me to just not to let anyone use my code in their project.
You can use this project as you wish and even copy the whole code.
